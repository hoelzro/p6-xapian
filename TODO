  - Str (get-description)
  - kebab case forms
  - Exceptions (see what other bindings do)
    - Pass a callback that takes an exception to handle it?
  - Support Utf8Iterator
  - Docs (is there a way I can import them? improve generate c++? https://getting-started-with-xapian.readthedocs.org/en/latest?)
  - Binding more classes
  - Handle enums
    - Casting integers into them in the C call (actually, no; this happens rarely enough that it's not a problem to fix by hand)
    - Generating them in Perl 6 land (there are nine enums, do it by hand)
  - Handle static methods (there are six; do it by hand)
  - static const int (there are about four of these)
  - Tests (look at xapian-bindings)
    - generate these too?
  - Examples (see examples in Search::Xapian)
