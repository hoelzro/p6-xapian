  - Str (get-description)
  - kebab case forms
  - Binding constants
  - Tests (look at xapian-bindings)
    - generate these too?
  - Docs (is there a way I can import them? improve generate c++? https://getting-started-with-xapian.readthedocs.org/en/latest?)
  - Exceptions (see what other bindings do)
    - Pass a callback that takes an exception to handle it?
  - Binding more classes
  - generate alternates that use optional arguments instead of multis?
